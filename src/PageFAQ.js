	   <h4 className="title">What measures does each mini storage complex take to ensure the security and safety of my items?</h4>
	   <p>Whether it’s household self storage, commercial storage or auto storage, security is the number priority at every Renewable Storage location. Our public storage facilities across Canada feature:</p>
	   <ul>
	     <li>On-site management (Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario)</li>
		 <li>Concrete and steel construction</li>
		 <li>Individual door alarms</li>
		 <li>Electronic security</li>
		 <li>Controlled access systems</li>
		 <li>Good lighting</li>
		 <li>Security cameras and more</li>
	   </ul>
	   <h4 className="title">Some storage companies have a 4-week rental period, which means I would pay for 13 months of rent in a year! Does Sentinel do the same?</h4>
	   <p>No we don’t. If you move in on the 14th of the month, your rent is due on the 14th of each month. With Renewable , there are only 12 months on our calendar!</p>
	   <h4 className="title">Can I pay for a partial month’s rent or do you just charge a flat monthly fee?</h4>
	   <p>Our rentals have a one-month term minimum. After this minimum is met… If you need a storage unit for a few days into the next rental period, Renewable is one of the few companies that allows you to pay a daily rate.
	      This daily rate is on a pro-rated basis and is allowed with the first 15 days of your term. Here’s how it works: You move in on July 14th and need your unit until August 20th. You would pay for one month (from July 14th to August 13th),
	      plus the remaining seven days at a pro-rated amount (that’s seven days instead of a full month)! Need 16 days or more? Then another full month of rent will be charged.</p>
	   <h4 className="title">How much notice do I have to give when I need to vacate my rental unit?</h4>
	   <p>Many storage companies require 30 days notice and will charge you for a full month if you miss this deadline.</p>
	   <p> At Renewable, we understand that you don’t always know when you’ll need to pack up and move on, so just let us know when you take the last of your items out of your storage unit and we’ll cancel your Storage Agreement. Easy as that.</p>
	   <h4 className="title">What is your refund policy?</h4>
	   <p>Renewable Storage will refund unused prepaid months of rent upon vacating. We will also return a partial month’s rent if you vacate within the first 15 days of the rental period.</p>
	   <h4 className="title">Do I need content insurance or does my home insurance protect my belongings in mini storage?</h4>
	   <p>You need specific content insurance. Home or business insurance will typically not cover items stored away from your insured premises for a length of time.
	   Renewable offers affordable content insurance that will protect your possessions and provide liability coverage as well.</p>
	   <h4 className="title">Does Renewable Storage offer any guarantees or warranties?</h4>
	   <p>Our guarantee of great service is backed by our track record of over 30 years of satisfied customers. In addition, security and solid construction ensure risk is kept to a minimum.
	   Similar to other property rentals, you are responsible for purchasing content insurance.</p>
	   <h4 className="title">What is your cancellation policy?</h4>
	   <p>A deposit of $50 is required for online reservations. This deposit protects Renewable from lost rentals during the reserve time and may not be refunded if we hold the unit and the reservation is cancelled. Otherwise, the deposit is applied to your first month’s rent.</p>
	   <h4 className="title">Does Sentinel Self-Storage require security deposits? Are they refundable?</h4>
	   <p>For regular indoor public storage units, no security deposits are required. However, a small security deposit is taken for winter car storage, mailbox rentals and business centre offices. 
	   For auto storage and the business centre, the deposit is returned upon vacating if there is no damage. A mailbox deposit is returned when the keys are returned.</p>
